# Project Title

This was a simple trial bot, my first attempt at writing anything meanningful with python(lol).\
I needed a bot i can use to access the chat-GPT from whatsapp.

You will need to install openai as a dependency on your computer. You can do that using pip or conda\
To install the 'openai module', open a command prompt or terminal window and run the following command:

or 
conda install openai
```
You will also need to install the twilio dependency
```
pip install twilio
```
